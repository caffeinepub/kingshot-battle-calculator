  "summary": "The diff implements OCR-based image upload infrastructure with canvas utilities, text parsing helpers, and form integration. However, the core OCR library (tesseract.js) is intentionally not installed, leaving all OCR functionality as a placeholder that throws user-friendly errors. The implementation provides the structural foundation but does not deliver functional OCR extraction capabilities.",

      "id": "REQ-24",
      "requirement": "Add tesseract.js as a frontend dependency to enable OCR processing of uploaded scout report images",
      "reason": "tesseract.js is not added to frontend/package.json. The ocrExtraction.ts file contains a comment stating it's a placeholder and requires tesseract.js to be manually installed.",
